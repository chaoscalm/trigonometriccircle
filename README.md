# wip

MathJax maybe look good, but we will have to deal with the loading, also needs to fix the double rendering of the values, also the MatrixBackground can cause various problems.

# nointernet

The nointernet branch is actually better in my opinion, the default rendering is not so bad, there is small improvement by letting it remote rendering.
